### overcome overfitting for a regression model. Regularization is one of the methods widely used to make your model more generalized.
### Lasso regression is a regularization technique. It is used over regression methods for a more accurate prediction. This model uses shrinkage. 
    Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point as the mean. The lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e. models with fewer parameters). 
    This particular type of regression is well-suited for models showing high levels of multicollinearity or when you want to automate certain parts of model selection, like variable selection/parameter elimination.

    Lasso Regression uses L1 regularization technique (will be discussed later in this article). It is used when we have more number of features because it automatically performs feature selection.
