Exercise 9.4.3
Create an app that lets the user upload a csv file, select one variable, draw a histogram, and then download the histogram.
For an additional challenge, allow the user to select from .png, .pdf, and .svg output formats.

Solution. 
Adapting the code from the example above, rather than print a t-test output, we save the plot in a reactive and use it to display the plot/download. We can use the ggsave function to switch between input$extension types.
